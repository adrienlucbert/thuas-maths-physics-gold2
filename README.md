# Physics simulations

This is the second gold achievements for the Maths & Physics class in THUAS'
Game Development & Simulation minor.

## Instructions

Create 4 physics simulations:

- bouncing balls
- objects in a fluid (buoyancy)
- billard balls
- strings

### Requirements

- Do not use Unity built-in maths/physics components or code
- Ignore air friction
- Assume all collisions are elastic, except one of the bouncing balls

### Result

*Work in progress*

## Credits

This project is the work of [Adrien Lucbert](https://github.com/adrienlucbert),
and the Maths & Physics class was given by Rick Appleton.
